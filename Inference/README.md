This folder contains the files used in the inference unit final project for easier access in Google Colab.

## Data
This project uses data from the 2019 National Youth Tobacco Survey (NYTS). Since the original dataset has dozens of variables,
we have taken a subset of the data in four pre-processed CSV files in order to simplify things. More information on the original
dataset can be found at the following link: https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/surveys/nyts/index.htm.

## Files
There are 4 files of data, denoted with .csv, along with corresponding 4 data dictionaries, denoted with .pdf.
These should include:

e-cigarette-reasons.csv
student-info.csv
tobacco-frequency.csv
tobacco-tried.csv
