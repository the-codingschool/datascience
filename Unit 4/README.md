## Iris Data
This dataset is taken from the iris dataset in scipy toolkit, with irrelevant columns and rows removed. Details (for the full dataset) can be found here: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/index.html#iris-dataset)

The dataset consists of 50 rows and 2 columns, with each row representing a single iris flower. The columns are ID and petal_length (this gives the length of the petal in [cm].)
