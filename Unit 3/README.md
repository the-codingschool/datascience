## Outpatient Procedure Volumes
This dataset includes data on "the aggregate count of selected outpatient procedures performed within the outpatient department from all-payer data." In other words, the total outpatient counts grouped by procedure performed for each hospital. It was originally published by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). Since the website it was originally published on has been re-arranged, we are using a forked version on GitHub. You can read more here: https://github.com/ajcampbell96/OutpatientProcedures/blob/master/README.md.

There are roughly 4,000 rows and 15 columns in this dataset. Each row represents a hospital. The columns are: provider_id (hospital ID), hospital_name, measure_id, gastrointestinal, eye, nervous_system, musculoskeletal, skin, genitourinary, cardiovascular, respiratory, other, footnote, start_date, and end_date.
