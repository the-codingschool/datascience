## Outpatient Procedure Volumes
This dataset includes data on "the aggregate count of selected outpatient procedures performed within the outpatient department from all-payer data." In other words, the total outpatient counts grouped by procedure performed for each hospital. It was originally published by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). Since the website it was originally published on has been re-arranged, we are using a forked version on GitHub.
