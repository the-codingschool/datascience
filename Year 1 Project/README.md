# Tracking COVID-19 Trends Data

Both files found in `nyt_covid_data` are pulled from the New York Times Covid Dataset, found [here](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data). The data is up to date as of January 7, 2021, and in the project the student is only asked to use data up until December 13, 2020, as this was the last day without vaccinations.

The county population data is pulled from the US Census API, at `https://api.census.gov/data/2019/pep/population?get=POP&in=state:*&for=county:*`.
